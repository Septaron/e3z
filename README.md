# e3z

Sourced from Killian's e3 v5.1.33 (r7). 
The beginning master here has some minor and cosmetic modifications to the afore mentioned version. Most of these can be found documented at the beginning of the file e3z.mac.
There are also some older comments from Killian about changes he wanted to make scattered throughout at the beginng of the individual files.
There are some comments that I added in the code that are prefaced with the "date" and "Septaron" if you would like to search for them.
In some cases I have commented the original code lines and added replacements. This was done to assist me if I needed a memory jog or to revert back to the previous code.
